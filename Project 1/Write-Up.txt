In this simulation, you create a triangle by moving the sliders to determine the lengths of the three sides, as well as the height.
Based on what you input for those, you will then see the perimeter and area of the triangle you have made.

What makes this interesting is that not all of the measurements you determine correspond to both the perimeter and the area.
For example, if you leave the base at 0, then the area will remain at 0 as well.
Technically speaking, you won't have a triangle at all then, but the point still stands.
So, make sure you pick a number for everything! :)
